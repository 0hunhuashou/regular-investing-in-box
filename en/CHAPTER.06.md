## 6. 为什么他们都那么聪明却总是做出错误决策

Before starting investing in the trading market, everyone felt that they were terribly normal...

After starting to invest, it will not take long for most people to become dejected, depressed, and emotionally anxious. why? Most people will desperately find that everything in the past is wrong! **Wrong one or two times,** how can all the operations be wrong? Facing such results, no one can be calm.

When the market was soaring, they found that they had sold it for a long time; when the price fell down, it actually appeared after they had just bought it. One day they found themselves escaping from the top yesterday, but after a few days they found out that they were only shocked out of the game; One day they felt that they had bottomed out, but after a few days they found that they were only picking up the knife a few days ago; they felt that the target in my hand was too slow compared to the other one, so they changed the car and found that they were following the high speed. On the road, the line is the same, anyway, the lane in which you are located is always the slowest...

有个股市的段子，能够清楚地描述那些 “韭菜” 们的感受：

> I have always wondered why: Why can I control the whole market with a small retail investor? No matter how crazy the previous rally, it will definitely fall when I buy it! Even if the 30-day support line has been broken, the fork has been forked again and again, and it will rise as soon as I sell it. I am in a short position and the market is skyrocketing. The dealers who hold the billions of funds are staring at the tens of thousands of dollars in my hands. What the hell is this? !

所以说，每个人在进行所谓的投资一段时间之后，就开始怀疑自己有病。

In fact, there is indeed a disease - rickets? **Ignorance** .

"**Stupidity**" and "**ignorance**" are actually not the same.

Because stupidity means poor IQ, and ignorance means uncivilized and uneducated. The IQ of the hominid is not bad, and Liang Qichao’s IQ is not bad, but whether it is the primitive person or Liang Qichao, even Einstein, if the time machine can let them "pass through to the future" to see Bitcoin, they are all the same, as it is difficult to figure out all at once. This is the difference between "stupidity" and "ignorance."

Ignorance is not because of stupidity, but because it is uncivilized and has not been educated by good education. This is not born, it is just that there is no difference in effective education. If an 8-year-old primitive man has crossed today, as long as he is going to school normally, even though he is stupid, he is not ignorant. When he is in high school, he can be stupid but he still can understand that the law of gravity basically is. He is too stupid, but he can still understand the coin-throwing and why the probabilities of the front and the back are the same - he may eventually appear to be much smarter than Copernicus and Zu Chong!

Therefore, the so-called investor who just rushed into the trading market is theoretically as if the primitive man rushed into the modern financial market. He is not stupid, but he is uncivilized, he is uneducated, he is ignorant, so he is very confused... In other places, it is fine to be confused, but it is different here. Every time the confusion after making the decision based on ignorance, it is the loss of real money, which is very cruel.

For this situation, the overwhelming majority of people are superficial. They believe nothing more than, "Oh, I am not suitable for this!", "Oh, my luck is too bad!", "Hey! I don't have that life!", "Hey, it seems that I am the kind of person who is only suitable for doing something real..."

The last sentence is definitely an excuse for your own ignorance. It’s like when a ugly girl has never received a love letter, but the explanation that she has never received a love letter is “I am not that kind of person!” — It seems that pretty girls who receive love letters are like ......

所以，症状看到了，病根也找到了，那应该咋治呢？还是那句话：

> **How to solve problems? Only by fixed investing!**

交易市场上从来都不缺聪明人，然而，虽然他们聪明，但他们不见得不愚昧，所以他们才屡屡吃亏。定投，不仅仅是一种投资策略，从另外一个层面上来看，定投是必须践行的行为，所以，理论上来看，定投是最好的投资教育，也是最好的投资教育实践 —— 所以，一个人是否聪明根本不重要，重要的是，在定投的持续践行过程中，最好的投资教育完成了，定投者会逐步摆脱愚昧走向文明。

You see, when people see a disease but cannot cure it, they can always come up with many explanations that are easy to understand. For the failure of the transaction, their summary is strikingly consistent: Oh, I am too greedy. It seems that the word "greed" can explain everything - can it really be like this?

It is often the case that a person buys a subject, for example, the cost is $10. Then, when the target rose to 20 yuan, he did not sell it, but after a while, the target fell all the way and fell to the point where he couldn't stand it... Whether it fell to 12 yuan, he sold it, or fell to 2 Yuan he sold it, he will always regret. Then, the evaluation of your regret is, hehe! I am too greedy, why didn't I sell it when it was 20 yuan? !

In the trading market, greed is universal, as everyone is greedy, or otherwise what are you doing here? So, is greed a sin? Surely not. The power of people to confuse concepts is surprisingly large, especially the ability to confuse two diametrically opposite concepts. When they made big money, they called greed as ambition, and when they lost big money, they called greed as sin. What is the use of this ambiguous definition, besides messing your brain?

其实，根源根本就不在所谓的“贪婪”上。根源原本应该非常清楚：

> These so-called investors bought what he couldn't understand, so he couldn't judge the standard price at all.

10 元的时候，他根本不知道这 10 元是合理还是不合理？20 元的时候，他还是不知道这 20 元是合理还是不合理？12 元的时候、2 元的时候，他依然不知道这个 12 元或者 2 元是否合理还是不合理？

What is the basis for his shot? In fact, it is just the so-called "follow the feeling." In expert terms, it is "**a random strolling fool**." Because the result of a random walk is not moving in place - of course, the ending of such people is not as good as a random stroll, because they will not stay in place, they will slowly sink into hell.

How does fixed investment cure this disease?

You see, the fixed investment means that from the very beginning, it has locked in a target that is almost inevitable rising for a long-term bullishness, and it is still the target of [BOX](https://b.watch) that dilutes the opportunity cost, and the bet is not a certain project, but the whole Emerging industry development. Furthermore, the fixed investment plan itself decided to hold multiple cycles for a long time...

In other words, the initial purchase decision is reasonable, and then, in less than a few years, or after a long period of time, there is no way to know the outcome. In the meantime, all prices are actually reasonable, regardless of the high or low, regardless of the ups and downs - until the final result is flashed.

Under this premise, it is indistinguishable that the price fluctuates by a few percentage points when purchasing. Ups and downs, in fact, it has nothing to do with yourself, but it is just the noise of many random strolling fools on the market. Look at it after many years...
