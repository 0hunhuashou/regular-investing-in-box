## 4. Is there any investment target that only rises not falls?

As an ordinary person, when you realize the magic of the trading market, find out that there is a way to let the world's smartest people work for your money without threshold, and let the world's smartest people help you choose the best investment for free, although it is not necessary to be smug, there is absolutely no need for a hint of inferiority. Because the vast majority of so-called investors in the trading market are half-baked – even the vast majority of investment managers in suits are half-hangers...

If you don't believe it, I can quickly teach you a very effective trick.

在遇到任何在你面前扮演专家的家伙的时候，你都可以轻描淡写地问一句：

> …… 那你如何稀释机会成本呢？

Usually, you will find that the other person will instantly diverge his pupils in his eyes, and his mouth will start to flash his words... If you do not believe, just try it!

When we adopt the free best advice provided by all the smart people on the market, we will face another trick, which is if we only buy Vanke, or just buy any one of Guizhou Maotai, Apple, Coca-Cola and even Chinese Tobacco, we face a serious problem:

> **只投资单个标的的机会成本无限大！**

这绝对是任何普通人都能理解的概念！

The so-called opportunity cost means that if your money is used to invest in a certain target, the money cannot be used to invest in another target at the same time... If you invest A with some money, then the money cannot be simultaneously used to invest in B, then B's future gains will become the opportunity cost of the future earnings of your investment A.

If you only invest in the only target, then your opportunity cost is infinite! Therefore, even if it is a greenhorn, you can instantly understand why you must find a way to dilute the opportunity cost! Investing is a comprehensive thinking technology. You can't just consider the possible rate of return. In addition, you must also consider the risk... And “**how to dilute the opportunity cost**” is also an important factor that must be considered!

有没有办法呢？肯定有！一个简单的办法就是投资一系列优质标的。当你购买指数基金或者 ETF 的时候，你的投资对象不再是某一个优质企业或者项目，而是一系列优质企业或者项目！

There is a subtle focus here that has been overlooked by many people. By purchasing a range of quality targets, you effectively dilute the opportunity cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, the attributes and quality of your investment target have changed! **Your investment target has become the target of only rising and not falling in the long run**!

Is it so amazing? Absolutely.

It is very, very difficult for high-quality companies to achieve long-term success. Even good companies are likely to decline. You have heard of Kodak and you have heard of Nokia. Companies such as Coca-Cola and Kweichow Moutai are extremely rare, and even they might face the Black Swan event and face the disaster. Therefore, investing only in one of the best companies, on the one hand, has an infinitely high opportunity cost. On the other hand, there is no effective way to circumvent the black swan event. The farther it is, the farther it is.

However, does the world have the target of rising and not falling in the long run? some! That is **the economic development of mankind**.

这也是为什么长期来看，股票市场的价格指数只有一个趋势，上涨。短期的涨跌，构成一个又一个的微笑曲线（或者猥琐曲线），全部拼接起来，就只有一个趋势，上涨，就算中间肯定有起伏，最终，还是上涨。

以下是标准普尔 500 指数过去 40 年（1979 ～ 2019）间的价格趋势图：

Therefore, when you invest in a series of high-quality targets, what you “gamble” is no longer a certain enterprise. The target of your “gambling” actually becomes the whole economic development... You bought a series of high quality standards in the Chinese stock market, then you are actually betting on China's overall economic development! You bought a series of high-quality targets on the US stock market, then you are actually betting on the overall economic development of the world - because excellent companies from all over the world are likely to go public in the US! You bought a [BOX](https://b.watch) (there are three high-quality assets in the blockchain world, BTC, EOS, XIN), then you are no longer betting on Bitcoin, or a blockchain project. What you actually "gamble" is the development of the entire blockchain industry.

Therefore, when I design the [BOX](https://b.watch), the most important consideration is the development of the blockchain technology. The blockchain technology development route that I have said in many places:

> 可信账簿 → 可信代码 → 可信执行环境 → 可信设备……

Historically, I certainly didn't miss Bitcoin in 2011; in 2016, I did not actually miss Ethereum; in 2017, I was the angel investor of EOS, the hottest blockchain project with a market value of more than $5 billion in 2019. Similarly, the MIXIN Network is also a project of my heavy position - if it is once or twice, it may be good luck; if it is repeated again and again, or even four or four times, it is not only good luck, right? Logic is the only tool available to humans in the face of the future. In this design, there is no secular selfishness, because [BOX](https://b.watch) designer Li Xiaolai does not charge management fees (this may be the world's first blockchain ETF that does not charge management fees), and, more importantly. Yes, Li Xiaolai can only make money by investing in [BOX](https://b.watch) under the same conditions as everyone else.

In fact, the real magic of the stock exchange market is here! Here, anyone can keep up with the economic development of the entire human race or society as a whole. The beauty of globalization is that ordinary people in Japan can buy American stocks to keep up with US economic development during the recession of the country; ordinary Americans can buy Chinese stocks when the US economy is stagflation to keep up with China's economic development; even if ordinary Chinese people are inconvenient to buy Japanese stocks and US stocks, and even buying Hong Kong stocks is not convenient... they can also invest in almost the world's almost ubiquitous blockchain trading with all ordinary people around the world. The market has kept up with the subversive rise and development of the financial Internet.

这里有个隐秘的重点：

> There is no target that only rises not falls, and only the target that does not fall in the long run .

In the book "Self-cultivation for Leeks", I tried to correct a truth that most ordinary people misunderstand:

> - 交易市场在即时交易过程中的确是零和游戏 —— 看起来对手的盈利来自于并恰好等于你的亏损。
> - 交易市场对那些长期投资者来说却绝对不是零和游戏 —— 因为他们的增长主要来自于经济增长，而不是他人短期的亏损。

这也是为什么普通人在交易市场唯一靠谱的投资方式就是定投的最核心原因。反过来看，作为普通人，你只有长期投资、长期持有才是万无一失的。

It is impossible for ordinary people to have a lot of money in the early days. However, by means of fixed investment, ordinary people "gamble" their own ability to make money off-site and long-term fixed-term discipline. This is a big big stakes! Because your time is an absolutely exclusive asset, it can only be an asset with an infinite opportunity cost. So, when you use your best value, high-value assets with unlimited opportunity costs as an investment, you can only choose the target that is foolproof. What is it? It is the development of the entire economy of mankind. Apart from this, there is no other choice.

以当前的时间点来看，区块链市场优于股票市场，股票市场优于房地产市场，房地产市场可能优于债券市场，债券市场可能优于银行储蓄…… 而定投，是普通人因为自己手中一开始不可能有太多钱，所以只好赌上自己的未来的投资策略，所以，在选择投资标的的时候，当然要想尽一切办法选择最优标的。如果在未来的某个时间点，最优标的不再是区块链市场，那么就应该换到另外一个最优质的市场 —— 这根本不是什么人们常常挂在嘴边的信仰决定的，这是实用主义价值观决定的。

这种精妙选择方式带来的结果，会给自以为普通的你带来神奇的感受。你会惊讶于你怎么就那么貌似轻车熟路地观察到并理解了绝大多数人想象不到的事实：

> **天上飘着的云的边界其实与地上城市的边界全无关系！**

When others are still listening to the weather forecast to judge the local weather today, you have already locked your eyes in the sky, and find ways to know in advance which piece or which clouds will rain... **The realm** is obviously different! It doesn't even feel too much when using the fancy word of **ambition**...

最后，还有更为重要的关键需要补充：

> Fixed investment is a long-term continuous investment behavior, so the investment target must meet the "**long-term bullish**" attribute.

于是，若是在这个属性上极度严格，那么结论也非常显而易见。债券、黄金、房产 —— 更不用提潮牌运运动鞋了 —— 都不是合格的定投标的，因为它们根本没办法满足这个必须满足的属性。从这个角度，你也能马上理解为什么巴菲特对科技股异常小心，却对可口可乐异常放心了……
