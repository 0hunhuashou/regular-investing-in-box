## 9. 定投策略神奇力量背后的深刻机理

让我们从一对看起来是对立的概念说起：

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.7 在主动的边界内你还有多少空间

之前提到，“**凡是对你产生重大影响的，都不是你所能控制的**”。你现在知道了，你之所以无法控制那些对你产生重大影响的因素，是因为他们在你的主动边界之外。

However, do you know? Within your active boundaries, there are a lot of things that you can control but you just gave up directly...but you never seriously thought about how terrible it is, merely because no one has pointed it out sharply to you. So you cannot care, as you don't know.

先看个例子，蝙蝠侠。

Of course, there is no comic hero Batman in this photo - I want to show you the front-leading cyclist, who is known as Batman, whose name is [Daniel Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish). Daniel, born in 1966, after born in less than 13 months, he was blinded by eye cancer. Yes, this blind person is doing what you absolutely can't think about - he is riding a bicycle without any other auxiliary equipment... The other two are also blind, taught by Daniel! - Yes, this kind of magical skills cannot only be practiced but also taught!

Daniel explored a way to "see". He continually makes a sound from his mouth, and then perceives the world like a bat through sonar. He calls this method *Echolocation* ... and so people call him "Batman." There is [a speech](https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_kish_how_i_use_sonar_to_navigate_the_world/transcript?language=zh-cn) from Daniel on TED. Let's take a look and see what it means to be an "eye-opener".

这位蝙蝠侠的例子，将被用来进一步讲解一个特别令人惊讶的话题：

> **Really active people are completely not believing in fate.**

Do you believe in fate? Do you dare say that you are not at all? There is a long distance between full faith and no faith at all. No matter which scale you stand on, it is not "total disbelief in faith."

![005](../images/005.png)

With just one second of self-examination, you will find that **it is really hard to completely not believe in fate**! It seems to be a matter of special courage, or why do you suddenly find yourself **hesitating**? And still **very hesitant!** Even, you can feel that there is a force in your heart that is against your choice - although you really want to choose not to believe at all, but you are hesitating; although you do not understand why, do not know what hesitating, anyway, hesitation is clearly there.

Don't sigh, nor feel self-conscious. This is not the feeling of you alone. This is basically a situation close to 100% probability. Whether is it 99% or still 99.99%? Anyway, on the other hand, 1% or 0.1% is a very small number. Few people do not believe in faith at all - very few of them, and most of them are nothing but ignorance and fearlessness...

并且，这也是事实：

> 随着时间的推移，绝大多数人的站位会从右向左靠拢 —— 也就是越来越信命。

Think about it, when you were very young, like almost all the children, you did not devoted to faith; but at that time, you didn’t know what the “faith” thing was. The people who are more and more faithful will eventually completely believe in faith in the end. Of course, in their self-explanation, it is not called "finally believe in faith", and it is called "**awakening**". If you really can't choose "not at all believing" here, then forget it. If you are hesitant, but still want to know what is going on, please be prepared before reading:

> **一切的真相都没有任何义务照顾你的情绪。**

自己选罢。这肯定需要勇气，并且还是很大很大的勇气。勇气是什么？**勇气是唯一不可伪造的美德。**

再问一个更进一步的问题，请仔细思考后再回答：

> 请问过去影响将来吗？

再深入一步，请问，

> Will the past definitely affect the future? If not, how much influence does the past affect the future? Is it a lot? Or is it not that big?

Still not finished, we need to ask till the end:

> 过去影响未来的程度如果并不是那么大的话，有没有可能干脆切断过去和未来之间的联系？

What is believing in faith? In fact, the matter of faithfulness has nothing to do with religion. It is not really related to superstition. It is completely caused by a loophole of logical thinking. The so-called superstition is just thinking with loopholes but not knowing where the loopholes are. The result is nothing more. You see, after the electricity was invented, the story about the demons and ghosts was not as good as it was before, wasn't it?

In essence, believing in faith is nothing more than to think that the past will inevitably affect the future. If you think that the past does **not necessarily** affect the future, then you will be suspicious of the matter of faith, think about it. Is this the case?

Now you can understand why I will think that "the **truly active people are completely not believing in faith** "? Because truly active people will find through simple and correct logical thinking, and sometimes we can even **completely cut off** the seemingly inevitable **connection** between the past and the future.

The most eloquent basis comes from the familiar probabilities. Have you heard of the gambler's fallacy? The gamblers don't know the concept of **independent events** in probability. They can't understand that the pros and cons of the next coin flip is an independent event, so all the previous results will not affect the next result at all - the next throw the probability of the front and back of the coin is still 1/2...

Never underestimate this simple scientific knowledge. This kind of thing has a huge impact on our lives - most people know and learn it, but rarely use it... As for it, there is no way to talk about it.

如果你能理解独立事件的概念，如果你能明白那些陷入赌徒谬误的人有多么可怜，那么你就能自然而然地明白另外一件事情：

> Those who mistakenly believe that the past will inevitably affect the future are actually more pitiful. The gamblers in the casino, because they don’t understand the concept of independent events, fall into the gambler’s fallacy. What they lose is only his gambling at that time, and those who believe that the past will inevitably affect the future, directly lose all the future!

There is a good past (this probability is very low for most people); if it is not good in the past (this is a great probability event for everyone), and at the same time that the past will inevitably affect the future, then, what is the difference between the subsequent life and the living dead?

**The so-called total disbelief in faith is that a person makes up his mind and then tries his best to prevent his bad part in the past from affecting his future.**

人生一切值得挣扎的地方，就在这里了，只有这里。

The above Batman Daniel is such a person. Through his own efforts, he made the past event of "losing his eyes", to the greatest extent, relative to other blind people, not affecting his present and future...

In real life, I also know another person like this, a Chinese, a woman - Liao Zhi. More than a decade ago, when she was in the Wenchuan earthquake, she lost her daughter and lost her legs when she escaped from earthquake. Her career is a dancer! A few years later, during the Ya’an earthquake, a reporter accidentally photographed a girl who was desperately trying to save people. She was surprised to find that the two legs of the girl who was struggling to save lives were prostheses... Liao Zhi is the rare one capable of cutting off the connection between the past and the future that seems to be inevitable. Later, Liao Zhi took the initiative to end her unhappy marriage life. A few years later, she met a Taiwanese from the United States who specialized in prosthetic limbs. You guessed what Liao Zhi said to the big boy that she later married and lives with?

> 你能让我长高两厘米吗？那样就完美了 —— 以前我可没有这样的机会！

If you are completely committed to faith, you don't have to make any investment, because your past, which is generally not good for ordinary people, will definitely determine your future. We have seen before, through the fixed vote mode, you not only do not let the past affect your future, even because you actually panned your entry time forward, you are like sitting in the time machine and going back to the past to fix it. Your past and then return to the future again.

这就是为什么我之前、现在、以后都会反复说一个重点：

> **定投策略成功的关键在于心理建设。**

心理建设从哪里开始啊？从绝不信命开始。不要让你的过去之中不美好的部分影响你的未来，掐断它们之间的联系 —— 至于美好的过去，让它继续发挥作用。在这个地方拼命挣扎，这是最具价值的挣扎，一切未来美好的根源。然后开始逐步探索确认主动边界，然后在主动边界之外寻找趋势，体会被动的力量……

定投策略看起来无比简单，无非就是**针对某个投资标的在很长的时间内定期投资一定的金额。**

However, after in-depth thinking, in-depth research, and even exploring without feeling, we will understand that the magic of the fixed investment strategy is actually very delicate. It is not just to make you a disciplinary people with opportunities and motivated people by locking in long-term holdings, and it also forces you to find the best investment target for long-term ups and not downs, but it also secretly does a lot of things:

> - 它向你提供一个独一无二的可用来深刻体会主动边界之外被动的神奇力量的环境；
> - 它用不可反驳的实际结果向你展示过去与将来之间的联系绝对不是必然的；
> - 它给你一个机会让你认真对待自己在主动边界之内做到极致……

Even, you may not think of it, it will eventually turn you into a relatively rare clean person - you just have to complete the plan quietly, either fail or gain great wealth. If you succeed, then you are harvesting **absolutely clean wealth**... Ask, is there a cleaner way to make money than this? With this way, what are your willingness and motivation to do other messy things?
