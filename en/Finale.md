## 结语

I hope that I can explain it to you - I know it is very difficult, and you will also admit that it is really difficult when you have been reading here.

说来说去，我只是向大众无差别地传递一个简单且确定的事实：

> **我们都是普通人，不过，我们中的每一个其实都有机会活得并不普通。**

方法也很简单：

> Within your active boundaries, you need to continue to strengthen mental construction, and desperately think of ways to make money off-site; at the same time, outside the active boundaries, you need to actively choose [BOX](https://b.watch) , and use the money you earned off-site regularly invest... ... In the long run, you can use the magical passive power generated by the trend to gradually get rid of the shackles of class solidification - and finally, you will gain freedom.

Looking back, it is not a day or two for me to write books. The publication of "Treating Time as a Friend" is also a decade ago.

This time, my mentality of writing "Determining Destiny" is very different, because it seems to be the most practical one in the methodology of my communication - the way of practicing is too clear, and the goal is very realistic and exciting.

So, this is not just a printed version of the text type book, but it is actually a very complete product:

> - 践行方法论：定投
> - 践行标的：BOX
> - 践行额外补给站：[b.watch](https://b.watch)
> - Practice community: Xiaolai's classroom of fixed investment

这其实也是这些年我把编程这门手艺重新捡起来的一个直接结果。

On January 2, 2019, I finally started to rewrite a book I wanted to write more than ten years ago, a programming book that was really friendly to beginners. In July 2019, ["Self-study is a craft"](https://github.com/selfteaching/the-craft-of-selfteaching) was put on sale. A few days later, the book became the "No. 1 in the new book list of computer books". In fact, on March 15th, 2019, after I put the electronic version of this book on the github, I became the world's first open source project that has been ranked 16th.

I am learning programming not for writing the code for all the products I want. My purpose is simple:

> 如果我多少懂一些，那么我就有能力更有效地连接优秀程序员，也能跟他们更低成本地沟通……

若不是我的确多少懂一点，现在我也没办法给你提供一个完整的产品和践行环境，不是这样的吗？

有什么动力使得我做这么个东西出来呢？我有句话，叫做：

> **Practice makes perfect!**

It is not a shackle, but a **practice**. I admire practice, for what cannot be practices is useless. If I can make a clear statement and provide the standard and environment of practice, that would be great, isn't it?

Many years ago, my wife gave me a song, and the lyrics are like this:

> 我能想到最浪漫的事，就是和你一起慢慢变老……

I laughed, and then I said, this may be you, but I think different. She asked, what do you think?

I said,

> The most romantic thing I can think of is to **grow rich with you**.

虽然不押韵吧，但好像更浪漫。你知道最浪漫的是什么吗？许多年过去了，我做到了。

其实吧，这并不是我的原创。在此之前读书读到过，沃伦·巴菲特就非常不理解大多数人。他很奇怪一件事儿，为什么人们都不喜欢慢慢变富呢？天天只想着暴富，却半点都实现不了，而后要郁郁而终地死去。为什么不能接受慢慢变富呢？为什么不喜欢慢慢变富呢？

现在，我想把当年我对我老婆说过的那句话改一改送给你：

> **我能想到最浪漫的事，就是看着你慢慢变富。**

你从听到，看到，想到，一直到最终真的**做到** —— 还有比这个更幸福的事情吗？

而我，从想到直至做到，现在竟然有机会看着别人因为我的分享而终于做到 —— 还有比这个更为浪漫的事情吗！
