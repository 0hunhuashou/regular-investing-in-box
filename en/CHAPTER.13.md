## 13. The most important good news: for ordinary people, long term is not forever.

When an ordinary person listens to Buffett and says, "My **long-term is forever**", no matter who is on the side of the mirrored world, this person more or less will feel a little despair. Although no matter which side of the ordinary people are the same, the slightest despair is definitely not from doubts about what Buffett said. That desperation comes from the pity or pain that almost everyone has to face before:

> How do I know? ! (Or, if I knew it early, it would be great!)

In particular, when we think that when Buffett was 11 years old, he bought his first stock in life, and at an early age he had the opportunity to ask Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing... Compared with others, it’s our nature- human instinct, and once this instinct starts, the desperation will be overwhelmed, and everyone feels hopeless!

可事实并非如此 —— 这绝对是个令人超级解脱的结论，只不过，需要我为你慢慢论证。

这一条肯定能让很多普通人倍感欣慰：

> **每一代人赚到的钱，都比上一代人赚到的钱更多。**

And, more than a little more, but the difference in magnitude. This is not caused by inflation that many people joked. The reason for this phenomenon is simple and clear, because human society is developing, science and technology are advancing, and the scale of the economy is rising... This is the dividend of the times, and the dividends of this era are theoretically inclusive, which is in each generation everyone in the world should have access, or at least have the opportunity to receive the dividend of this era.

To put it simply, when Buffett was 11 years old, there was no Apple in his world that could reach the trillion level. Apple's market capitalization has soaring through trillions to become a spectacular milestone in the history of human economy. Prior to this, there was never a consumer product design and production company that was able to sell its products to such a high level that it lasted for a long time. On the macro level, this is the result of the continuous development of business in human society and the rising economic scale.

Each generation has its own understanding ceiling. Buffett struggled for so long before he bought Apple's stock, which is basically his ability limit - not to mention bitcoin, blockchain; to Buffett's theoretical system and cognitive limits, even Google (Google), Netflix, and Amazon can't be grasped. In theory, each generation has the limits of this particular generation, including the current younger generation. Over time, their exploration of their own active boundaries will come to an end, not because they don’t want to progress, but because of another motivation that is supported by economic theory: it is enough, even if it is no longer progressing! Of course, therefore, more boundary exploration will inevitably be done by the next generation.

然而，还有另外一个比上述理由更加能够令普通人解脱的根据：

> **经济周期的时长正在逐步缩短。**

Human development, including the development of the economy, why can't it gradually rise steadily, why does it always have to jump up and down? Can it be as stable as I am?

Where does this fluctuation come from? Perhaps you have heard a noun, referred to as "Kangbo", the full name I can never remember, so I have to go through Google to copy Wikipedia and then get back and paste as the reference: " **Kondratyev long wave**." This "Master Kondratyev" is the first Russian to study the big cycle. The so-called Kangbo is a cyclical economic cycle phenomenon of about five or six decades. Generally, this long wave is divided into two phases, a rising phase A and a falling phase B.

The above picture explains the brief situation of the world economic trends under the long wave theory framework.

Although the guiding significance of this Kangbo theory in practical applications is always unclear and difficult to be quantified by the academics, and it is not too much valued by the academic community. Now Kangbo theory is only the theoretical cornerstone of many unorthodox economics.

然而，这并不影响我们从中理解一个简单的事实：

> - A rise is not a trend, and a decline is not a trend neither.
> - 一个上升加上一个下降，构成一个周期。
> - 判断趋势需要至少两个周期……

两个周期之后，那两个波动所构成的，只能是三种趋势之一：上升、水平、或者下降。

And when we look at the global stock market index price trend over the past four decades, we are seeing the overall upward trend of the cycle of many rises and falls.

若是我们看看比特币的价格走向，或者区块链数字资产总市值的价格走向，也都一样，是由许多个上升下降构成的周期连接起来的上升趋势走向。

Then, why did the Great Depression of the 1930s recover in such a long time (that is, a cycle is completed), and the repair of the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s took only a few years? Furthermore, in this century, why is the global economic recession triggered by the US subprime mortgage crisis had been repaired faster?

The reason is very simple and straightforward, as anyone can understand:

> 信息的高速流动使得全球化协作更为连贯更为容易，因此，虽然危机依然会不断产生，但修复速度正在变得越来越快。

To put it another way, **the formation of the economic cycle is essentially caused by sometimes coordinated and sometimes uncoordinated by multi-party collaboration.** - this multi-party referring to so many nodes that there is no way to know the existence of other nodes - when the communication efficiency becomes higher and higher, the duration of the cycle will change accordingly. It is getting shorter and shorter, although fluctuations—that is, occasional disharmony between multiple parties—may never be eliminated.

This is also the main reason why the fluctuation cycle of digital assets in blockchain is relatively short. In the past eight years, I have always heard that many people use Bitcoin to halve the amount of mining, that is, four years, as the basis for the judgment of the cycle. Perhaps at the earliest time, there was still a little bit of truth. This judgment is gradually losing its meaning when the market value of Bitcoin is no longer the total market value of blockchain digital assets.

I believe that the volatility cycle of blockchain digital assets is generally shorter than the stock market cycle, and the core reason for the shorter and shorter future is that the multi-party coordination efficiency of the blockchain trading market is obviously higher. From a point of view, you can understand that there are only a few influential stock markets on the planet, and what about the blockchain trading market? You can see it at coinmarketcap. Thousand are continuously operating 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. Do you say that market coordination efficiency is far beyond the traditional stock exchange market?

周期正在缩短，这个简单靠谱的结论对普通人来说是什么意义呢？简单说就是：

> **所谓的 “永远” 正在缩短。**

If the "forever" has been shortened, will it be too long in the long run?

What is long-term? In my opinion, for ordinary people, the so-called long-term is just " strong0}at least two major cycles" - this is the long-term; if you can spend three cycles, basically equivalent to Buffett's forever... ... How long is the two cycles? The current market value fluctuation cycle of blockchain digital assets is about three to five years. Therefore, in about seven years, there is a high probability that it has already passed two cycles. Please note that the focus is on **two major cycles**, not seven years.

怎么判断周期？很简单啊，你找最近的历史最高点，把那里当做当前周期的 B 阶段（即，下降阶段）的起点，到下一次众所皆知、随后从那里跌落的历史最高点，那就是 B 阶段之后，A 阶段（即，上升阶段）已然完成，进入了下一个周期…… 如此循环往复。

需要注意的是，这样的一个大周期，对任何人来说，只有 B 阶段的起点是已知的，因为那是当前已知之前的历史最高点。至于 B 阶段什么时候结束？A 阶段在 B 阶段结束的同时开启，又到什么时候 A 阶段结束？你现在是没办法也没必要判断的。判断了也没用，因为那只是一个周期而已。然而，当两个周期过去之后，你就是没办法不知道已经过去了两个周期，不是吗？

At that time, whether you want to continue to hold, or want to cash out, or cash out a part, continue to hold a part,  is totally up to you - now you may not imagine what the future will look like, but I can use my experience to tell you that your biggest change is exactly the same as everyone who really does it:

> **You will be as calm and serene as never before.**

You are an ordinary person, and how long is your long-term? I have already told you, as the answer is very simple, two big cycles or more. This is why we finally choose the blockchain digital assets as an ordinary person, and choose the reason why [BOX](https://b.watch) is scheduled to fixed invest, because in here, the two cycles are really short – especially in the near future, after you actually spend two cycles and look back, you will fully understand what I said.

别急，因为所谓的长期其实真的没多久。
