## 1. 为什么要投资区块链数字资产

理论上，定投策略可以用来投资很多标的。在未来的十年中，有个过去并未受到广泛重视的一种标的就是区块链数字资产。

先说比特币。比特币是地球上第一个应用区块链技术的数字资产，这一点毋庸置疑。过去的十年之中，比特币饱受争议。每一轮的价格上涨下跌，都会反复被宣告死亡 —— 迄今为止比特币已经至少被宣布死亡 364 次。大家可以记住这个网址，它上面记录着能够收集到的历史上比特币被死亡的历次言论。

Many people like to play with new vocabulary, and will tell you expertly that bitcoin has now gained consensus... and so on. Regarding the technical details of Bitcoin, I need to use another special class to explain. However, it is clear from this point that in blockchain technology, the word "consensus" refers to the consensus between the machine and the machine, rather than the consensus between people. .

There is no standard communication agreement between people, and there is almost no way to produce a valid consensus. It’s not that there is no consensus, and the only consensus among people of all kinds that I can think of is making money. Besides that, there is no consensus among people. Therefore, in the future, please don't confuse the special terminology, as it is easy to reveal what you really know.

The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is not because of the "price consensus". So what is it? To illustrate this point, I have to create a vocabulary that is called "**all difficult to rebut**." What is "all difficult to rebut?" Even if you accept or nor, the key is that everyone can hardly deny it. This is called "all difficult to rebut".

Therefore, it is not awesome when all "people accept", but "**all difficult to rebut**" - that is, no one can deny the fact. The reason why Bitcoin is so powerful is not because one day it will be accepted by everyone. Believe me, that is impossible. Is the dollar so powerful? You eat big food stalls in Beijing night market, and try to pay in US dollars? In most cases it will not be accepted. However, no one will seriously value the dollar.

Now that Bitcoin has reached this point, it is no matter of what, if it rises or falls, it will be "all difficult to rebut". Today, ten years after the birth of Bitcoin, the value of blockchain technology has long had an attribute that is difficult. And the value-added trend of digital assets based on blockchain technology is equally difficult – the most important reason for investing in blockchain digital assets.

八年前，我开始投资比特币的理由很简单：

> 我们已经见识过互联网是如何通过大幅度降低信息流通成本（降低至几近于零）改变这个世界的；如果现在有个东西能够大幅度降低资产流动成本（降低至几近于零），那么这世界必然因此发生巨大变化 —— 至于是多大的变化干脆想象不出来，正如三十年前我们没办法想象互联网是像今天这样改变世界的一样。所以，如果当年投资互联网是正确的，那么我去投资区块链也是对的，之前那是“信息互联网”，现在这可是“金融互联网”。

Today, eight years later, Bitcoin is no longer the " **social experiment**" of the year. It has long been a " **social practice**." The trend of continuous development is not only difficult, but more importantly, this trend is long and long.

Bitcoin, according to the plan of its white paper, has to be dug up to 2140 years... Ten years ago, I saw such a plan and thought it was a fantasy. However, now that ten years have passed, Bitcoin is no longer an "experimental" but a "practice". Then, this runway has 120 years! Basically it exceeds the limits of life for all today's audience. Therefore, I think I can't find a longer runway at all.

然而，更为重要的是，十年后的今天，可投资的区块链数字资产标的不止一个了。当年我入场的时候，只有一个标的，就是比特币。其后的几年里，虽然有成千上万的山寨币出现，包括今天依然活跃的莱特币，但在我眼里靠谱的只有一个，就是比特币。

只有一个投资标的的时候，有一件事情是解决不了的：**无法稀释机会成本。**

现在不一样了，现在有很多靠谱投资标的，那么，我们就有办法通过投资一系列标的完成这个重要的投资策略：稀释机会成本。这是很重要的投资策略，只可惜绝大多数所谓的投资人完全不具备这种基础概念。

This is why I want to design and launch a package of solutions to the underlying [BOX](https://b.watch). In the existing traditional financial market, this kind of investment target is called ETF, Exchangable Trading Fund. This concept can't be justified from the term, but you can understand it through the basic properties of the ETF:

> - 把一系列标的锁定在一个篮子中；
> - 配有一个市场上可交易的 Token 锚定这个篮子的价值；
> - 在一定的条件下，Token 持有者可以通过缴回 Token 赎回该篮子中对应的标的。

[BOX](https://b.watch)就是这样的一个 ETF。
