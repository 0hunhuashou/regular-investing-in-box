## 2. Why fixed invest in BOX?

[BOX](https://b.watch) is the abbreviation of Btc + eOs + Xin, and the [BOX](https://b.watch) itself is exactly the meaning of the Chinese "box". Since [BOX](https://b.watch) is an ETF product designed by Li Xiaolai, the market is calling it “chives pie”, and “fixed investment BOX” is called “to eat a leek pie”.

Purchase and redemption regarding [BOX](https://b.watch) are listed on the website b.watch: https://b.watch

### 2.1. [BOX](https://b.watch) 细则

BOX, very simple, is **the blockchain certificate** (Token) that anchors the “package of mainstream blockchain asset investment targets”. Its composition is as follows:

> - 1 BTC
> - 1500 EOS
> - 8 XIN
> ---
> = 10,000 BOX

In other words, if you want to exchange 1 [BOX](https://b.watch), you should use 0.0001 BTC + 0.15 EOS + 0.0008 XIN.

> - 你可以用相应数量的 BTC+EOS+XIN 直接换取 [BOX](https://b.watch)；
> - 你还可以在满足一定条件的情况下，缴回 [BOX](https://b.watch)，赎回相应的 BTC+EOS+XIN；
> - 你还可以用 USDT 在二级市场上直接买卖 [BOX](https://b.watch)……

用 [BOX](https://b.watch) 赎回 BTC+EOS+XIN 的条件如下：

> - 你的 [BOX](https://b.watch) 市场价格总计已经超出 10,000 美金，赎回手续费 1%；
> - Or you can sell it directly in the secondary market, the fee is 1‰ in both directions;
> - Or you set your earliest redemption time when you invest (for example, if you set yourself three years later)...

[BOX](https://b.watch) is an ETF fund product - just that this fund is different from the fund you have seen before, ** [BOX](https://b.watch) does not charge management fees**; in other words, its management fee is zero. why? Because the designer Li Xiaolai did not want to earn this management fee. And <strong data-md-type="double_emphasis">Li Xiaolai himself is also fixed to invest for [BOX](https://b.watch).</strong>

[BOX](https://b.watch) is 100% transparent. [BOX](https://b.watch)'s position is open and transparent, and ready to check - because all records are on the public chain of Mixin, please refer to the bwatch instructions for the address. How many BTC+EOS+XIN are in the “chives box”, and how many [BOX](https://b.watch) Tokens are circulating outside, how many [BOX](https://b.watch) Tokens are in the “freezer bin” (including unreleased and future recycled quantities)etc.. all are open and transparent. Therefore, [BOX](https://b.watch) cannot be added at will, nor can it increase the amount of circulation at will. Because of this, if the [BOX](https://b.watch) is put on any other exchange, the user can check to confirm that the transaction does not have "arbitrary additional circulation" - why this is critical, the novices need to spend some time to learn understanding.

### 2.2. [BOX](https://b.watch) 的优势

[BOX](https://b.watch)的成分选择与配置，遵循以下几个原则。

### 2.2.1. 投资区块链资产就要投资主流资产

In the new round of trends, blockchain mainstream assets will be disproportionately valued. After the big cows and big bears from 2017 to 2018, the market has been educated, and the “blind optimism” and “blind expectation” of the new currency have been completely poked. The project of raising funds by simply writing a white paper has been proved to be "vulnerable"...

In the new round, either a mainstream asset or a pyramid scheme asset could rise hugely– We don't touch the pyramid scheme asset not because it doesn’t make money. On the contrary, it may be very profitable in the short term, but it can’t be long-term, so it is not our choice of the fixed investors. Fixed investors are going to cross more than one bull and bear market trend, so they can only choose long-term targets. Therefore, in "either mainstream assets or pyramid scheme assets", we can only choose "mainstream assets."

### 2.2.2. 符合区块链技术发展的内在逻辑

After many years, which is exactly eight years to date, after years of observation, investment, practice and thinking, I believe that blockchain technology has a development path in the process of changing the world:

> 可信账簿（BTC）→ 可信代码平台（ETH/EOS）→ 可信执行环境（Mixin）→ 可信硬件（？）……

In fact, this is my personal investment path. After Bitcoin, the cloud coin that I invested in and later closed became the first exchange on the planet to trade Ethereum (ETH). Later, I invested in EOS and Mixin. The core of investment success lies in the fact that “investment behavior fits into the law of development”, so that the trend becomes a friend of mine to continuously exert its own investment, instead of making the trend become its own enemy or resistance.

现在这个 [BOX](https://b.watch) 的成分选择就是与区块链技术发展的内在逻辑所契合的。

What is to be explained here is why EOS is selected between ETH and EOS? Although ETH appeared before EOS in the trusted code phase, the difference between them is like the difference between DOS and WINDOWS - EOS is multi-threaded. Moreover, the technical side of EOS, which is BlockOne, is the company with the strongest financial strength in the blockchain world. Therefore, it is more reliable, and in the long run, the probability of success is higher.

When our bidding is converted from a single project (such as Bitcoin) into a series of targets (such as [BOX](https://b.watch) ), in addition to effectively diluting the opportunity cost, we are equivalent to transforming ourselves from putting our bet on " a certain project" into "the development of the entire industry", which is a reliable methodology to reduce risk to the extreme.

### 2.2.3. 成分比例的考虑

现在（2019.7）Bitcoin Dominance 在区块链资产总市值中占比 63%。这个比例虽然短期内可能继续拉升，但，长期来看，它还会随着区块链技术的发展普及和应用逐步降低。不是比特币不发展了，是它发展的同时，其它资产也会发展，但长期来看，其它资产可能发展速度超过比特币。所以，给比特币 50% 的权重，从放眼长期的角度来看，是合理的。

The remaining half is mostly allocated to EOS and XIN in a 4:1 weight ratio. This is because I personally think that the development speed of XIN will not be bad, or even fast.

Outsider have a major misconception of [Mixin](https://mixin.one) that people think Mixin is a chat software only. In fact, Mixin Messenger is the chat software, or social software; while the Mixin Network is a public chain, and Mixin Messenger is the first Dapp of the Mixin Network. The vast majority of public chains on the market (even including the [EOS of](https://eos.io) July 2019) still have no decent Dapp - the most common so-called Dapp is nothing more than a dice game.

Mixin Network 在技术路线上走了个不一样的路径。

别的公链都是**自下而上**（Buttom Up）的方向：先开发好公链，然后再开发公链上的 Dapp —— 所谓的 “打造生态”。

Mixin Network's approach **is top down**: first make a very useful Dapp (ie, Mixin Messenger), and then gradually deepen the development of the underlying public chain. Therefore, Mixin Messenger was released very early (2017.12). More than a year later (2019.2), the Mixin Network public chain was officially launched. As for the so-called Dapp like "Dice Game", it is just a robot that can run in Mixin Messenger in the Mixin Network. Ocean.One is a decentralized autonomous governance exchange running in the Mixin Network and a technology pioneer in the blockchain industry. More applications are on the road. For example, the [BOX](https://b.watch) I designed and its exchange market [b.watch](https://b.watch), without the public chain of the Mixin Network, can't be done at all - the so-called public chain is not tried. However, it is simply not available. Because of this, in my design, the proportion of XIN in the [BOX](https://b.watch) is actually slightly higher.

To sum up, there is only one sentence. [BOX](https://b.watch) is an ETF product that you can't lose anyway - because if it loses, it's just because the blockchain industry is proven to be no good, which is the thing that you can't blame me or blame yourself. However, <strong data-md-type="double_emphasis">as long as the blockchain industry is good, [BOX](https://b.watch) is bound to be good</strong> – and the blockchain industry is taking off, so we will win on a high probability. It's that simple.
