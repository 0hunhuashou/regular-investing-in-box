## 3. The only correct way for ordinary people to invest is fixed investment

先直接说结论：

> In the magical place of exchange market, **the only correct way for ordinary people to invest is automatic investment**-Remember this!

Since [BOX](https://b.watch), the first blockchain ETF on the earth, has just been established (July 3, 2019, the so-called “seven-three leek festival” of the “Double-Eleven”) and its data is not long enough, so it cannot be used as the modeling example to explain the only reliable way of investing for ordinary person.

The predecessor of the [Longmen Fund](http://www.longmen.fund/) (https://longmen.fund) was the Bit Fund, which was founded by Li Xiaolai in 2013. It was liquidated in 2018. Some investors decided to continue after five years. So, the ETF product, Longmen Fund, was created. The Longmen Fund is not open to the public. Currently, only a small number of invited people who are qualified can invest.... However, because it has long-term transparent data, it can be used here as an example of bidding.

以下是龙门基金的网站 2019 年 7 月初的截图：

为了使用这个数据作为定投的例子，我们只取每个月的数据看一看：

假设你从 2018 年 9 月开始，每月定投龙门资本 1,000 美元，一直定投了 11 个月…… 那么，数据大抵如下：

In other words, in the case of a monthly fixed vote, you will miss the highest point, $92 on June 25, 2019; you will also miss the lowest point, $23 on December 15, 2018... But, finally yours The average price is $54, and the current price is around $85. After 11 months, you have invested a total of $11,000; and your current book value is $19,141.44 - even if it is based on the price you made last time, $82 - even $1 less than that of from the previous month... However, you the yield has been **74.01%** !

看以下配图，你能更清楚地看到你所投入的本金和当前收益的关系：

在以上龙门基金的 11 个月的数据之中，价格曲线画出了一个迷人的 “微笑曲线”。

The people who adopt a fixed investment strategy in the market are always a minority, and the so-called " smile curve " above is likely to be a diametrically opposite " wretched curve " for those who have not adopted a fixed investment strategy. It is definitely not a kind smile, but the evil smile of the clown you saw in the Batman story - his mouth is still gloomy: "Why so serious?"

Now look at the data again, assuming that your investment method is the kind that most people love to do, the so-called "a shuttle"... Then, in September 2018, you will go in for $11,000 and then take after 11 months, there is no loss, because you will have about **10.81%** of the proceeds! —— Although it is far away from **74.01%** , there is no loss after all!

However, according to the nature of your special love of a shuttle, the possibility that you can keep it all the way after 11 months is actually not big. why? For a shuttle, this curve is definitely a wretched curve.

别说接下来的每个月了，接下来的每一天、每时每刻，你都会痛苦万分焦虑不已。在接下来的整整半年之内，你唯一的感受就是你的资产在每分每秒地缩水。

痛苦和快乐并不是对称的。我们的基因决定我们的感受。赔掉 10 块钱的痛苦远远大于赚到 10 块钱的快乐。你那感觉绝对就好像是正在被那个邪恶的小丑蹂躏，并且看着他吐吐舌头，听着他阴森地嘟囔，干嘛那么当回事儿啊……

If you are an investor with a fixed investment approach, then you are in a completely different world – although they look exactly the same, although most people except you can’t understand your feelings because all the feelings are the opposite.

** Fixed investmentis the behavior to use of your own long-term period to support something**. So, since you have gambled on your own future, then you have thought through it when you choose. Therefore, the price generated after the first purchase falls, and every decline is the time for you to lower the average price. A shuttle man is there to experience the cold winter, shivering, but you are the opposite, you are refreshed, you add more low-priced chips for you and feel happy...

A shuttle man can't stand the pain of too long - in fact, no one can suffer for a long time. This has nothing to do with the so-called "strong". From another point of view, this is not stupid, it is just ignorance. After a month of pain, or two months, or three months, or even afterwards, it seems to be going to pass, which is, in the sixth month (or before), many people will be based on various reasons for leaving - This kind of behavior is called "cutting meat" in the trading market... You see, the leek is cutting itself, and the bloody meat is cut.

What about you who are fixed investing? Are you insisting? No! It should be like that! If in the process, you look at the low-priced chips but you are stopped by people, you will fight with him - blocking people's money, like killing parents. Don't you agree? Are you cold? Are you shivering? You can't feel it! You are excited, every time you make a vote, you are very excited, because every time the average price is reduced is equivalent to "**moving your admission time forward**" - you will not be as annoyed as many half-hangers every day, "Hey! what if I knew this earlier!" Or "How do I know?" They all think that they are late... You are different, you know that your behavior is constantly ahead of your relative admission time.

After six months, the price began to climb slowly... Do you think that the person who left the market by cuttingmeat at the beginning will rush into this shuttle at this time? Will not. They are afraid of death - the experience of being born before death will make their expectations of fear stronger. So, almost 100% probability of happening is that they are hesitating, and they don’t have any chips in their hands to watch the price rise... When they fall, they run because they are afraid of death, and now they are more afraid when they rise. — Until their moods collapse, the price may be already high. When they start the next wretched curve, they are actually entering the market...

对他们来说，轮回是非常可怕的，因为无论他们如何做，他们感受到的都是恶意满满的世界。有了之前的讲解，现在解释起来就很简单，因为对他们来说，任何投资标的的价格曲线，都是由无数个猥琐曲线构成的。你说这样的命运有多么可怕？

You see, obviously the same world, but people may feel the opposite; is this amazing? If you are a person with a fixed investment strategy, then, for a moment, the same world is another way for you, because the price curve you face is made up of countless smile curves! In this world, happiness is inherently rare and scarce. I will ask you, is this kind of happiness that cannot be told to people more scarce and more precious?
