## 前言

我猜，作为一个普通人，你肯定不止一次听过一个令人心惊胆颤的词汇：**阶层固化**。

无论阶层固化是否真的已经存在，无论它是否真的正在逐步形成，它都肯定是令普通人一听就心头一紧的词汇。我不知道别人是怎样的感觉，反正我清楚地记得年轻的自己第一次听到这个词汇的时候那种接下来很久都忧心忡忡的感觉  —— 那不是恐惧，那好像是绝望。

This vocabulary is a source of anxiety for many people around the world. It’s not that you are afraid of it alone, and that you are not alone in facing it. Sooner or later, you will know that Koreans and Japanese have long accepted the status quo that their society has solidified. You will also hear that even Americans with different American dreams have experienced it to varying degrees. The solidification of the class is taking shape, not to mention the domestic media. They like to die. This natural untouched title can cause the anxiety of most people... The articles talking about this term are all worried, helpless, and provide no feasible solution after all the nagging.

This book is about the **path of }ordinary people getting rid of class solidification** - absolutely feasible, no water, and it depends on yourself. The **ordinary people** mentioned here are regardless of national boundaries, regardless of region, regardless of race, regardless of gender, regardless of age, regardless of height, weight, thinness, beauty, ugliness, regardless of sexual orientation... The key is that even IQ and education do not matter! In other words, this solution is applicable even to the little bustle boy who ran errands in Beijing...

很难令人相信竟然有这样的解决方案。更令人难以置信的是，那解决方案说出来竟然只有两个字：

> **Fixed Investment**

**投资**，是我能找到的唯一一个普通人可以跨越阶层的通路。而**定投**则是唯一一种所有普通人都有机会做、并且都有能力做好的投资方式。

> 所谓的定投，就是针对某个投资标的在很长的时间内定期投资一定的金额。

For example, in the next **5-10 years in** (a long time), **weekly** (regularly) investment **[BOX](https://b.watch)** that no management fee of block chain ETF products (investment target) **of $ 150 or 1000 yuan** (a certain amount)... Of course, you can replace the [BOX](https://b.watch) with any target that is worth investing in and holding for a long time, such as Apple stock, Kweichow Moutai stock, Coca-Cola stock, or Standard & Poor's index fund.

In any society, in any era, the vast majority of people are in a state of lifelong complaints. However, in today's era—the era of **today's free and mature stock exchanges** —the vast majority of people who complain all their lives don't know that each of them (yes, everyone) is actually missing the opportunity to get rid of all the complaints because of ignorance.

The freely-participated stock exchange market is a miracle in today's modern world – precisely because of its existence, all ordinary people have the supreme opportunity – as discussed in detail in this book.

Few books that can advertise like this:

> The "**cost of emptying**" for ordinary people who miss the book is **infinite**...

I haven't been exaggerated - although this is indeed self-selling, the melon that Lao Li sells is really delicious!

请继续读下去！

...... Not only that, **but after reading** it, you have to {strong1}read it again and again{/strong1}, until you decide to start investing, until if someone dares to stop you from letting you invest, you can't wait to be desperate with him - I know, you really understand. It must be like this.
