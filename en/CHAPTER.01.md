## 1. 投资是普通人摆脱阶层固化的唯一靠谱方式

In fact, class solidification more or less presents in any era and in any country with different degree of severity - there is no need to make a fuss.

The question now is whether hard work and sweat is a reliable means of getting rid of the solidification of the class? The answer to this question is very desperate: no. From the perspective of being able to get rid of the solidification of the class, it is really unreliable to fight hard and sweat. This is not my own opinion. [Frank H Knight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Knight), one of the most influential economists of the twentieth century, has a famous view:

> “决定一个人富有的三个条件，一是**出身**，二是**运气**，三是**努力**；
> —— 而这三者之中，**努力是最微不足道的。**”

Of course, this is not to say that hard work is not important, because being relatively successful can rely on hard work, while great success can only rely on luck - everyone knows that luck is impossible for ordinary people to control; and birth (or marriage) is definitely not the factor that ordinary people can rely on.

有一组数据可以帮助我们理解为什么努力那么微不足道。如果按照我们每个人的平均寿命为 **78** 年计算的话，

> - 睡觉时间加起来大概是 28.3 年；
> - 工作占据了我们人生的 10.5 年；
> - 9 years spending on a variety of social media;
> - 6 years spending on housework;
> - 花在吃喝上的时间有 4 年；
> - It’s really not long spent on real education, which is only 3.5 years;
> - It takes 3 years to spend on makeup.
> - 2.5 years spending on shopping;
> - 1.5 years spending  of child care;
> - 花在路上的时间有 1.3 年；
> ……

Calculated this way, the time that you can freely control is only 9 years... Just 9 years!

What is hardworking? If someone else works 8 hours a day and you work 10 hours a day, you do fight more than others; but in fact, you are just working two hours more than others - that is, only in those 2 hours, you really work hard - because in the other 8 hours, you are no different from others...

What is real hardworking? That is, everyone has only 9 years of free time, but you have used all that 9 years to work... But even if you use it all, it’s only 9 years... The above data does not deduct the time you may be sick, the time you may be depressed, nor the time when all kinds of bizarre accidents are bound to happen without exception!

This is why the hard work, sweat or effort actually do not allow you to get rid of the root cause of class solidification -no matter in which country and in which era.

They why invenstment can break the ceiling? **The essence of investment is to use your own money to make more money, which does not need rest and works for you 24/365, as long as you find the right investment**...... So, how do you compare your sweat with it? The reason we admire Warren Buffett is that:


> Warren Buffett was born in 1930. At the age of 11, he bought the first stock in his life. It has been 78 years till 2019!
> 78 年！—— 别人平均寿命 78 岁，其中只有 9 年是可以用来额外打拼的所谓有效寿命，可是巴菲特呢？巴菲特的钱已经帮着他 78 年每年 365 天、每天 24 小时地拼着……
> 这相当于说，不从事任何投资活动的普通人就算活上 8 辈子也追不上他！因为 78 除以 9 等于 8.6667……
> Moreover, Buffett’s body is still very healthy and will continue to live... More importantly, he has already made his investment into a business that went public (Bokxia Hathaway) – That is to say, even if Buffett’s father died, the money of this listed company is still working without interruption...

很惊人！

年轻的时候，我和其他年轻人一样，是非常拼的。

刚从学校毕业出来做销售的时候，我曾经可以一周内六个夜晚睡在火车上，早上下车找个洗澡的地方换衣服，然后做一天的培训工作，而后晚上踏上火车睡上一觉，醒来后就在另外一个城市里继续工作……

People who have known me for many years know that Li Xiaolai does  not have a holiday. Why is this? Because when I graduated from college in 1995, one day I suddenly thought, how many holidays are there? 365 days a year, there are 115 legal holidays! In other words, one-third of the year is “rested”! I always feel that something is wrong. Later, I noticed the word "legal", so I suddenly realized - oh, this legal holiday is used to restrict the employment of enterprises. On legal holidays, if enterprises do not let people rest, it is illegal... That is, this legal holiday is not restricted to individuals - there is no law to say: "Today is a legal holiday, and if you are not resting, you are breaking the law!" So, I decided that since then, the legal holidays have nothing to do with Li Xiaolai! So, from 1995 to 2019, 24 years have passed - I just have not had Saturdays and Sundays, no New Year's Day Spring Festival, and I have just spent these holidays as every day. Many of the books I have published are based on the fact that I have kept myself at home during the Spring Festival. Am I really fighting?

About a decade ago, I suddenly found that being "careful about my hair style" is a very high cost of time. It takes an hour or two to go to the haircut every month, and I have to wait in the barber shop for a long time... So, I decided to cut my hair later. A Philips electric hair clipper, which is really cheap, around three hundred dollars, can be used for several years. So you saw my fixed hair style for the next ten years, 3 mm round hair style. This is very simple. Basically, before a shower, I can use a hair clipper to fix my hair in front of the mirror for three or five minutes. You see, in terms of saving time, am I really fighting?

But what? The data is extremely frustrating. Look at me, there are no holidays in 24 years, how much effective life do I spell out for myself? Let's count it. Even if I don't use holidays as a rest day, the average effective working hour is 4 hours a day. It's great to work effectively. You will know if you really work for yourself. If you work efficiently, you know that there is still very little effective working time. So, what is my effective working time in these 24 years?

> 24 × 115 × 4 = 11,040

一万多个小时。那么这相当于多少年呢？

> 11,040 ÷ (365 × 24) = 1.26

You see, I am so demanding about myself, then what is the result? The result is only 14% more than "other people who are really hard". I decided to cut my hair 10 years ago and how much time saved myself? Once a month, each time an average of 1.5 hours, then 18 hours a year, 10 years down, is 180 hours ... You see, I use the actual action carefully, but is it really really enough? How much effective life can that increase? Or how long has it been compared to others? It was only 7.5 days, and with such a great effort, it was only 2.28 more than everyone else!

你现在明白了，**不投资是不可能摆脱阶层固化的。**

然而你一定被警告过：

> Investment is risky and decisions that need to be cautious! (Or, the stock market is risky, investment needs to be cautious!)

But is this really true? Whether it is true or not, you can only rely on your own actions to verify. Before you have long practiced, there is no answer that you can understand directly without practice.
