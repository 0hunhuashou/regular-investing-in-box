## 9. 定投策略神奇力量背后的深刻机理

让我们从一对看起来是对立的概念说起：

> **Active** and **Passive**

In general, active and passive are considered to be antonyms. “Active” is generally understood to be positive, while relatively “passive” is often understood as negative.

### 9.3 决定命运的因素常常在主动边界之外

这绝对是个值得注意的现象：

> **凡是对你产生重大影响的，都不是你所能控制的……**

换言之，这是更普遍的现象 —— 决定性因素基本上都在你的主动边界之外。

有很多例子。

For example, there is a snooker in the UK, Ronnie Antonio O'Sullivan, born in 1975. This person is very handsome, and because of his amazing skills, he is becoming more and more handsome and more charming. After winning the World Youth Championship at the age of 15, O'Sullivan had won 65 championships by 2018. He is very fast, his left and right hands are equally good, and his attention can be completely immune to the outside world; even if he doesn't want 147 points, he can shoot 146 points accurately... It is amazing whether to say he is genius or a legend.

然而，我要说的并不是奥沙利文这个人。

Here, we are more concerned about the **unfortunate** encounters with O'Sullivan's players in these years - which of them does not work hard? Which one is not diligent? Which one is not active enough on his own border? Which one is not quite excellent? However, each of them is Zhou Yu, and the words that are squeezed out are the same: Since Heaven made Zhou Yu, why he also created Zhuge Liang?

For those players who have encountered O'Sullivan, they either choose to simply give up snooker, or choose to give up the idea of being a snooker champion. Their "destiny" is irrelevant because of O'Sullivan alone. — This decisive factor is clearly outside the active boundaries of all players of the same generation.

From the perspective of O'Sullivan, he is obviously a rare success story – he has reached the extreme in his own borders and has achieved great success; but in terms of quantity, this is an example, even a rare example, without enough representativeness.

O'Sullivan's example is demonstrated enough here, but I just want to use this somewhat limited example to clearly show a common phenomenon:

> **The key factors determining fate are often outside the active boundaries** ...

However, accepting the above phenomenon is an extremely important cognitive starting point. It is very difficult to actively and desperately hone your skills within the boundaries. However, what is more important is not the most difficult thing, but the realization that there are more important and critical factors outside the boundary. And then began to think actively "If so, what should I do?" and then honed another set of skills.

所有的人都会在某个时候发出不约而同的慨叹：

> 为什么总是感觉自己无论做什么都晚了一步呢？

Don't laugh. Once, this is also my own hunting thoughts. In the northeast dialect of our hometown, it is: "why cannot I eat the hot shit?!" It is likely that it is a universal problem encountered by 99.99% of people... What do you think? I guess you will have at least one relative, classmate or something, and be evaluated by others:

> He, oh, I don't know, but how can he cannot finish everything or why does he always have bad luck? Maybe it is a bad fate?

When we say this or think like this, it is obvious that we understand "**the decisive factor outside the active boundary**" as "**fate**".

In the early 1990s, many capable people chose to leave China and travel to the rest of the world – longing for their dreams. Time passes by little by little, and in the blink of an eye, thirty years have been passed; basically these 30 years are when Chinese economy took the wind and waves to the peak. The vast majority of those who had left their homes in the past measured their own economic strength. Therefore, their final sigh was: feeling that their lives have been hollowed out for ten or twenty years...

Is this life? In essence, this is just the " **effect of the trend** ", not the individual's "fate" - because they chose to leave at that time; in fact, they could also choose to stay. Therefore, the neutral saying is nothing more than: their choices do not match the trend. This is to think that the other road is faster than the traffic jam on the high speed, so it turns out that the result is the fastest.

决定命运的关键性因素常常在主动边界之外…… 主动边界之外最关键的因素是什么呢？一个词而已：**趋势**。

The so-called "whoever understands the time is a great man" is a correct description, because people who do not understand the trend, or even feel the trend, can only be mediocrity. The so-called "time-made hero" is also a correct description, because the trend is outside the active boundary, but it plays a decisive role. Without the current situation, there is no hero.
